This plugin allows rapid toggling between the two different styles of ruby
blocks, namely do/end and brackets {}. To use, simply move the cursor to the
beginning or end of a block, and type <Leader>b. As a mnemonic, remember 'b'
for 'block'.

Note: You must have your cursor on the do, end, {, or } for the plugin to work
correctly.

When moving from a do/end to a bracket-style block, the plugin with attempt to
move to a one-liner if appropriate:

For example, if have the following ruby code:

  ['one', 'two'].each do |number|
    puts number + "!"
  end

After invoking <Leader>b, the resulting code would be:

  ['one', 'two'].each { |number| puts number + "!" }
